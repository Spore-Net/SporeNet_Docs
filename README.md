## License 
This Project and other Projects from SporeNet are licensed under the AGPL License. (See the License file for details.)

## Why SporeNet's Projects Use the AGPL License

We chose the AGPL (Affero General Public License) because we believe software should be open, transparent, and fair to everyone who uses it. Not just those who download it, but also those who interact with it over the internet.

Unlike more permissive licenses (like MIT or Apache), the AGPL ensures that:

Anyone can view, modify, and use the code.
If someone runs a modified version of this software as a service online, they must share their changes with users, just like they would if they were distributing software directly.
This helps prevent large companies from taking the work of open-source contributors, turning it into a closed, for-profit product, and offering it as a service without giving anything back. In that sense, the AGPL acts as a safeguard for community-driven development.

**But It’s Not Perfect**
Let’s be fr rq: the AGPL isn’t magic (even though we definitely wish it were [Hey, if it was that would be amazing {side note: would it be a genie if it was magic or would it just be magic powers like in Isekai and fantasy animes?}])

It doesn’t stop all commercial use; Companies can still use and profit from the software, as long as they comply with the license (e.g., by releasing their modifications).
Some avoid it because it’s “strict”. Even well-meaning developers or startups might hesitate to build on it.
It’s not always business-friendly, and some argue it discourages adoption and collaboration at scale.
Still, among widely recognized licenses, AGPL is one of the strongest tools we have to protect open-source projects from being quietly privatized in the cloud/SaaS era.

If you’re using this project and want to build a proprietary product or service around it, We encourage you to reach out.
We're open to discussing alternative licensing or collaboration. :)

Thank you for visiting and we hope all of our tools, resources, guides, and the like help you and assist in your needs and/or wants.
