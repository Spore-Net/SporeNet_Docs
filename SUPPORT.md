## Support SporeNet 

---

SporeNet is and always will be independent. 
No ads, no sponsors, no nothing besides the support from our community and those that do wish to donate and help us in our mission to fight against surveillance capitalism, Tracking, the erosion of privacy and anonymity as well as the decay of open source and free education to those who seek.
Everything here is free and open-source.
If you want to help us grow, you can contribute via Monero (XMR)
